# Methodology
I'm going to outline the various possible methods of taking FS photos.

The way I've done this in the past was effectively take a long exposure IR photo, regular photo, and either a slightly darker photo with a different focus and f stock, etc, or a UV photo (tbh I haven't fully worked out how to do that easily)
