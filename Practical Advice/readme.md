# How to do Full Spectrum (ish) photography relatively easily


## Infrared
Making an Infrared filter on a budget isn't the hardest thing, thank fucking god. I read somewhere ages ago that you could use a couple of strips of developed, but not exposed film stacked on top of each other as an IR pass filter. It seems to have worked

It is a little bit fiddly though, which can be annoying as fuck, especially depending on which lens you use. I more or less just stuffed them onto the lens, where they kinda just stayed precariously. 

## Ultraviolet
At the moment, I don't have a very reliable DIY UV pass filter. One that I experimented with was just getting the clear part of a CD case, then covering it with layers of glad-wrap coloured with blue or purple sharpie. Unsuprisingly, that was really shit.

The thing I'm gonna try (when I get time) is get some layers of blue and purple coloured plastic film, then use an iron to join them somehow (Some baking paper over the layers might work i think, but probably do some research if I haven't cleared it up by the time that you're seeing this)
